During BrickHack 11, we built Lumi - an AI assistant that pushed the boundaries of what's possible with current LLM technology. Here's what we learned about building agentic AI systems.

## The Challenge

Building an AI assistant that can not only understand voice commands but also execute complex tasks in real-time presents several unique challenges:

1. Real-time voice processing
2. Context management
3. Tool integration
4. Interruption handling

## Architecture Overview

Lumi's architecture consists of several key components:

```python
class LumiCore:
    def __init__(self):
        self.speech_processor = SpeechmaticsFlow()
        self.llm = GrokAPI()
        self.tools = CustomToolset()
        self.memory = ConversationBuffer()
```

## Key Learnings

1. **Voice Processing Pipeline**: Optimizing the voice processing pipeline was crucial for real-time interactions.
2. **Tool Integration**: Custom tools need careful error handling and clear documentation.
3. **Context Management**: Maintaining context while allowing for interruptions requires careful state management.

## Future Improvements

We're planning several improvements:
- Enhanced error recovery
- Multi-modal inputs
- Expanded tool set
- Better context preservation

Stay tuned for more updates on Lumi's development!
